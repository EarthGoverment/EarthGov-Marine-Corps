ent-CMWindowReinforcedAlmayerHull = hull window
    .desc = A glass window with a special rod matrix inside a wall frame. This one was made out of exotic materials to prevent hull breaches. No way to get through here.
ent-CMWindowReinforcedAlmayer = reinforced window
    .desc = A glass window with a special rod matrix inside a wall frame. It looks rather strong. Might take a few good hits to shatter it.
ent-CMWindowReinforcedWhiteHull = reinforced window
    .desc = An ultra-reinforced window designed to keep research a secure area. This one was made out of exotic materials to prevent hull breaches. No way to get through here.
ent-CMWindowReinforcedWhite = hull window
    .desc = A glass window with a special rod matrix inside a wall frame. It looks rather strong. Might take a few good hits to shatter it.
