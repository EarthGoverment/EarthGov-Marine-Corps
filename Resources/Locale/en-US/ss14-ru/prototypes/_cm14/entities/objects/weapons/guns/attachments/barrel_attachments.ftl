ent-CMBarrelAttachmentBase = { ent-CMAttachmentBase }
    .desc = { ent-CMAttachmentBase.desc }
ent-CMAttachmentExtendedBarrel = extended barrel
    .desc = The lengthened barrel speeds up and stabilizes the bullet, increasing velocity and accuracy.
ent-CMAttachmentRecoilCompensator = recoil compensator
    .desc = A muzzle attachment that reduces recoil by diverting expelled gasses upwards. Increases accuracy and reduces recoil, at the cost of a small amount of weapon damage.
ent-CMAttachmentSuppressor = suppressor
    .desc = A small tube with exhaust ports to expel noise and gas. Does not completely silence a weapon, but does make it much quieter and a little more accurate and stable at the cost of slightly reduced damage.
